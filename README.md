### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [research software engineer](https://ukrse.github.io/who.html) at the [Alan Turing Insititute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). My PhD is in Biology where I developed mathematical models to describe collective foraging behaviours in Honeybees and developed broad methods for evaluating scale in animal movemenet distributions.
