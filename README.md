### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [research software engineer](https://ukrse.github.io/who.html) at [The Alan Turing Insititute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I did my PhD in Biology developing mathematical models to describe collective foraging behaviours in Honeybees and developed broad methods for evaluating scale in animal movemenet distributions.
