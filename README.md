### Hi there 👋

I'm a quantitative ecologist interested in collective behaviour, animal movemenet and really anything that intercepts theory and data.

Now

- 🔭 I’m currently in my final year of my PhD at Royal Holloway University of London
- ⚙️ I work mainly in `R` but I also enjoy developing in `Python` and `C/C++`
- 🌱 I like to build novel models for interesting ecological processes and generalise those approaches into software packages
- 💬 Message me about modelling collective animal behaviour and movement patterns
