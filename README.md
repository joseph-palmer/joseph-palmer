### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [Research Data Scientist](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-08/da-rse_job_description.pdf) at [The Alan Turing Insititute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I did my PhD in Quantitative Ecology, developing mathematical models to describe collective foraging behaviours in Honeybees and developed broad methods for evaluating scale in animal movemenet distributions.

I am a multilingual programmer with a reservoir of skills that I employ daily to address real-world data science and modelling challenges.
