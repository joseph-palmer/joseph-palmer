### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm an AI Developer at Dyad AI. I did my PhD in Quantitative Ecology, developing mathematical models to describe collective foraging behaviours in Honeybees and developed broad methods for evaluating scale in animal movemenet distributions.

I am a multilingual programmer with a diverse skill set that I employ daily to address real-world data science and modelling challenges.
